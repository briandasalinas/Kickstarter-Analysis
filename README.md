# Kickstarting with Excel


## Overview
Working with excel to visually represent to our friend Louise how to create a successful crowdfunding campaign. Tables and charts are included to make it easier for her to understand how to go about her campaign.

### Purpose
 Through this data we wanted to be able to help Louise, a playwriter, prepare for her new play's crowdfunding campaign by analyzing successful crowdfunding campaigns through different categories. Our end goal was to mirror other successful campaigns that are in the same category as our playwriter to ensure her own success. 
 
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The months of May and June proved to be the months with the most success rates at launching crowdfunding campaigns. Louise should aim at launching her crowdfunding campaign in the middle of May to better her chances at succeeding. We want to stay away from launching our campaign in December. My reasoning would be because many people are buying holiday presents and aren't intrested in funding plays with those priorities in mind.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Most successful crowdfunding campaigns had a goal of $10,000 or less. Having a budget of that size has a probability of 70% success rate based on our data, one of the highest success rates compared to the rest. Having set this budget, it seems like Louise is on the path of having a successful crowdfunding campaign.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results
-Based on our *Outcomes Based on Launch Date* chart, we can see that any play that was launched in December has a poor outcome. There is about a 50% chance of it failing, which is the worst success rate compared to the rest of the year. On the other hand, launching a play in May would be the best option having a success rate of almost 70%.

-Looking over our *Outcomes Based on Goals* chart, we can see that the plays that set a goal for less than 10,000 had a higher rate of being successful. With 70% success rate, they stand with the highest success rate compared to the other goals. 

-Throughout this data we are unsure of who donated to the crowdfunding campaign. It would be helpful to have a target audience category and see how it affected its success rate. We could have a couple of different demographic categories to better help Louise market her crowdfunding campaign.

-We would like to provide our friend Louise a timeframe expectancy of her successful crowdfunding campaign. We can create a table where we compare how long it took the crowdfunding campaign to reach its outcome. This would give us an idea of how long she might have to fundraise to reach her goal of $10,000.
- I took the liberty to create that for her and she is looking at a time window of 21 to 30 days to have a successful campaign!![Outcomes Based on Timeframes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109987269/184272436-ac28ab2b-d74a-4ec9-857b-513b7f351931.png)
