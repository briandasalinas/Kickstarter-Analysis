# Kickstarting with Excel


## Overview

### Purpose
 Through this data we wanted to able to help Louise, a playwrite, prepare for her new play's crowdfunding campaign by analysing successful plays through different catagories. Our end goal was to mirror other successful campaigns that are in the same catagory as our playwrite to ensure her own success.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results
-Based on our *Outcomes Based on Launch Date* chart, we can see that any play that was launched in December has a poor outcome. There is about a 50% chance of it failing, which is the worst success rate compared to the rest of the year. On the other hand, launching a play in May would be the best option having a success rate of almost 70%.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Looking ouver our *Outcomes Based on Goals* chart, we can see that the plays that set a goal for less than 10,000 had a higher rate of being successful. With 70% success rate, they stand with the highest success rate compared to the other goals. (by 10,000s) 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
